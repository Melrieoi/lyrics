          "lyrics": "Seems as though the PTA has finally conquered Rome\nThey're gonna charge admission and enclose it in a dome\nNow it's just a theme park and the rides are ovcer-priced\nMaybe you can run the one that used to be your life\n\nTICs and refugees are scattered far and wide\nAnd many tales are told about the day The City died\nPainted ladies faint before the speculator's eye\nThe gravy boat will always float until the bay runs dry\n\nAnd everybody sighed\nAnd gets all misty eyed\nAbout the day The City died\n\nThis one's called I'm moving to Oakland\nThis one's called I'm moving to Portland\nThis one's called I'm moving to Brooklyn now\n\nProspectors and pushers still conspire to subdivide\nAnd many tales are told about the day The City died\nSkinny dips on crystal ships sail through the Golden Gate\nI left my heart in a shopping cart at the bottom of the Bay\n\nAnd everybody sighed\nAnd gets all misty eyed\nAbout the day The City died\n\nThis one's called I'm getting addicted\nThis one's called I'm getting evicted\nThis one's called another one moving away\nThis one's called I'm moving to Austin\nThis one's called I'm moving to London\nThis one's called somewhere in L.A.\nThis one's called I'm moving to Boston\nThis one's called I'm moving to Berlin\nThis one's called I'm off to Savannah, GA\nThis one's called I'm moving to Glasgow\nThis one's called I'm moving to Moscow\nThis one's called I'm moving to Detroit today"

I’m not to blame\nEverywhere I go blood drowns my trail\nBenign rule, lift the darkest veil!\nFor the piously raving\nWon’t decay\n\nAddled, but not to blame\nEverywhere I go blood drowns my trail\nBenign rule, tired eyes dream on\nFor the piously raving\nWon’t decay\n\nI’ll stay and wheeze: “Hail the Fane\nPick up your entrails\nMore to see\nAiling love comes your way\n\nI won’t decay”"

Wither with me!\n\nIn the black of night\nWe prepare the vulture’s feast\nCut down the guards on my command\nUnseen: the wave that sinks the land\n\nThey use our skin for parchment\nYoung fat for secret potions\nRancid temple; burn the wisdom!\nHigh time to rush into oblivion\n\nWe shall return to the sea\nStride down the old path\nTowards sunken graveyards\n\nWe shall return to the sea\nRecite this obituary\nAnd live complacently\n\nIn the black of night\nWe prepare the vulture’s feast\nCut down the guards on my command\nUnseen: the wave that sinks the land\n\nTo all who lurk and couch tonight\nI light a greeting fire\nI count on you to flush the land\nA hidden wave at my command\n\nAlliance: dark and foreboding\nBlood: the currency of power\nWoe to those deserving!\nGaze at the plunging breaker!\nI’m no minion\nI chase dominion\n\nIn the black of night\nWe prepare the vulture’s feast\nCut down the guards on my command\nUnseen: the wave that sinks the land\nTo all who lurk and couch tonight\nI light a greeting fire\nI count on you to flush the land\nA hidden wave at my command\n\nLust for dominion\nRaze the gates\nMy assiduous minion!\nSweet whispers raise the heat but\nCold is my blood"

          "lyrics": "At the waterfront, the waves assault\nWalls of rock in suicidal frenzy.\n\nEons of war, until the cliffs bow to the sea.\nBlue maws close, drooling with unrelenting jaws.\n\nBreaker, I’m sentient.\nIn my veins runs violence.\nI’ll hit granite and if I am to be crushed:\n\nBelt out chants of war,\nSongs of victory,\nAnd stir the maelstrom with your roar\nTo erase our untimely gloom.\n\nImpregnable forts defend the high ground.\nBut we are like the surf, will never run dry.\n\nExult and recite! No doubt you will join the fight.\nTo lofty hymns, our armies clash.\n\nLo and behold the wonder: all the lives linked by fate.\nAnd all those we break reverberate,\nAre uplifted by the roar,\nThe chants of war,\nThe songs of victory.\n\nWith ardent zeal, we fall. So bright.\nAnd I see the shoals, endless; one world shining. We have veered off the gray fog.\n\nPrane Koren leads. Soon we shall break down another wall.\nWe just go where the flames blaze and shut up the sobs. Seems to be all we ever knew.\n\nIf you need a solution, start prowling the ruins humming a song.\nAnd all those who chant wring peace from folly.\nAnd all those who sing cannot be overcome.\nCheers for the roar,\nThe chants of war,\nThe songs of victory.\n"

          "songName": "The Giver's Embrace",
          "lyrics": "In golden liquid, I\nNumbly drift away as time slips right through my closing fists.\nTell me about the light in the crevice\nWhere leeches dwell.\nMy sight blurs. Must I dive down\nTo this riverbed?\n\nOn glowing currents, habeli rides my mind.\nDissolved lore represses grief. My scars fade away.\nThe Giver’s embrace reveals Neekog’s true face.\nAm I destined to be the League’s last devotee?\n\nI don’t float alone. All the sages that I have slain swim with me again.\nUnder aureate streams glitters your eternal realm, untouched by the shadows\nOf the Torch where you burned in vain.\n\nSerene wit,\nI fully backed the schemes of my one true love.\nI was enthralled by our people’s deal and if she were alive, I’d have never left her side.\nSo, I strayed…\n\nThe Giver seeps through our ways,\nGnawing laws; a favor!\nThe ulcerous past and future are gone and\nThe now has escaped to nowhere.\n\nWell, you lead me astray, cannot feel my body’s frame.\nI sink down, tranquilly, was never offered a more convincing aim.\nHold on friend, that soul can feel me.\nA gentle touch and it says that it used to feed on pain.\nI pet its belly and reply: I found no repose\nIn all the dying that I’ve seen. Only here the anguish fades away.\n\nHence, I dream all night.\nThe cycle can never die.\nAnd how I marvel at the Brewer’s wisdom.\n\nWho can breed,\nIgnite the spark of innocent life?\n\nThe Giver’s flow is without end,\nWill last inside the heart, which is purely given away.\n\nAs I drink, quiescence comes to me.\nAnd as I drink, my vision settles.\nI am wide open.\nUnited, cannot be dissected.\nAnalysis; futile exercise.\nA sudden retch, and saliva wets the beach.\nFinally, I regorge. Astounded eyes blink moistly. All curled up,\nBeauty beholds the light of day.\nOnce, I was driven by vengeance, now, I give life.\nEmbraced, given peace. The wheel is nudged, can’t be stopped."

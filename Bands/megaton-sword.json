          "lyrics": "I swig from hallowed ground\nThis beast is gonna make it\nAnd ride your caitiff lives\nThe fields vacant graves\nThat chide the hoggish leech\nI'm the one who takes it all\nThe raving light of day\n\nI see you're bloody frail\nThe sort that makes me revel\nCane in, suck up the foam\nI heard there's no one there\nTo teach the only truth\nI'm the one that shines forever\nThe raving light of day\n\nAddled, but not to blame\nEverywhere I go blood drowns my trail\nBenign rulе, tired eyes drеam on\nFor the piously raving\nWon't decay\n\nPick the side\nCut up these fools and fight\nThe bitch knows no shame\nThey seek it in our wells\nI'm the one defiant heart\nThe raving light of day\n\nSuit yourselves\nMy drooling right\nPreaching from the grave\nYou seek a better, you seek a decent life?\nHear my counsel, I must know\nI'm the raving light of day\n\nAddled, but not to blame\nEverywhere I go blood drowns my trail\nBenign rule: tired eyes dream on\nFor the piously raving\nWon't decay\n\nWe read it in your face:\nBloomed, so weak, it all decays\nIn your rule, in my heart\nWish you the best, make it a start\n\nThey only maim\nWhen you're lonely\nOne day we will see you there\n\nOn a warded isle\nRotten and frail\nOne can always hear you pray\nBleat! I'm not to blame\nEverywhere I go blood drowns my trail\nBenign rule, lift the darkest veil!\nFor the piously raving\nWon't decay\n\nAddled, but not to blame\nEverywhere I go blood drowns my trail\nBenign rule, tired eyes dream on\nFor the piously raving\nWon't decay\n\nI'll stay and wheeze: “Hail the Fane\nPick up your entrails\nMore to see\nAiling love comes your way\n\nI won't decay”"

          "lyrics": "Grab your bracelet\nHope you will forgive\nAin't no time to save you\nHold my breath as they\n\nRush past this damp den\nBeat myself alive\nStopped the bleeding\nNow run, get out of here\n\nWho's the last?\nI call you to my side\nEat flowers on your path\nI cannot have you blind all the time\nLest you fail me, my dear\nDazed; time is flying\nAnd I, I watch you\nAs you're crossing iron plains\n\nLight stings my eyes\nI weep and stumble on\nCave roof's collapsed from ray-streaked ruins\nYour temple beams at me\n\nThey can't close in, so take it easy now\nFool of great insight\nUnbroken guard, awake all night\nSo still and silent?\nMust be gone; woken by rain, now, did I die?\n\nWho's the last?\nI call you to my side\nEat flowers on your path\nI cannot have you blind all the time\nLest you fail me, my dear\nDazed, time is flying\nAnd I, I watch you\nCrossing iron plains\n\nThe creep of night\nYou heal\nThe sleep is mine\nFound your lair, feel not a single limb\nI just see things differently\nOh, bold vertigo\n\nWho's the last?\nI call you to my side\nEat flowers on your path\nI cannot have you blind all the time\nLest you fail me, my dear\nDazed, time is flying\nAnd I, I watch you\nAs you're crossing iron plains"

          "lyrics": "If this is the end then what was it all worth?\nDon't bother to ask there's no price on this earth\nCause life's still a mistery, you can't cost-benefit analyse it\nAnd the ?hereafter? songs in our minds so we try to disguise it\nStill it shall be exiting to see, the end of the show\nAbramacabra baby, here we go\n\nThe meaning of life? Well I don't really care\nFor this could be the last time we come up for air\nAnd maybe there's really no reason to stay\nStill I play you a shanty to brighten your day\n\nCry out when they pull the plug on this world oh mechanic\n?A dream to get to play? on the deck of this last titanic\n\nI will dance on the gunwale as the ship's going down\nI will write no solemn epitaphs for a world that's gone insane\nWhen there is no tomorrow even then will I know\nThat as long as the mistrels are playing\nAll is not in vein\n\nMaybe the meaning was lost on the way\nMaybe we've achored at the last bay\nNow we'll not loose spirit, but it may not be sound\nSo crack open the barrels if we're really going down\n\n?Riots and the lights go out lord oh the vanished/banished?\nThey begged to be set free by the mad sailor that they banished\n\nI will dance on the gunwale as the ship's going down\nI will write no solemn epitaphs for a world that's gone insane\nWhen there is no tomorrow even then will I know\nThat as long as the mistrels are playing\nAll is not in vein\n\nI will welcome the gods in the ?depths of our? war\nStand up as they fire the first round\nI'll have peace of mind, when the new day will find\nNo consequese ... dust on the ground\nAnd I'll be as dead as the rest and it would not mean a thing\nMisantropoetica, allow me this last fling\n\nLiar ?then they cry?: freak absurd and manic\nBut when this ship turns upside down these rats will panic\n\nThe weight of the world, proved much to tough\nJust getting myself by along was more than enough\nBut remember my words like marks from a whip\nThis old salt will go down with his ship\n\nI will dance on the gunwale as the ship's going down\nWe will write no solemn epitaphs for a world that's gone insane\n\nI will dance on the gunwale as the ship's going down\nI will write no solemn epitaphs for a world that's gone insane\nWhen there is no tomorrow even then will I know\nThat as long as the mistrels are playing\nAll is not in vein"

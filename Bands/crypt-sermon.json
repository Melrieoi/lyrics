          "lyrics": "Gather at my feet, innocent children\nThese warning I beg you to take heed\nLeeding calls as I whisper, you know\nThese secrets that the devils try to keep\n\nLife is just a foolish game oh child\nWe play by the rules just to go another round\nAnd we cry we will lose and we say the rules seem so unkind\nAnd ... is the price for the fool who has followed the rules when deaths forces ?crown?\n\nNow theres another secret to remember\nI read it in the writing on the wall\nThere's a whisper of truth in everything\nThere is bitterness in the lies your father told\n\nIt may be revealed for only a moment and quickly it fades away\nLike teardrops on the spiders web before the morning ?gold?\n\n(Raise your) Raise your hands lift high your voice\n(Death is) Death is ... rejoice\n(...) Hell is on the right ... just to keep, keep our children now\nOh seize youself and be redeemed\n\nOh life is a losing game\nTry and fail, laugh an whail\nUp and down and round and round\nAnd we cry we will lose and we say the rules, the rules just seem so unkind\n\nAnd a little bit away at the dawn of the day\nWhen there's nothing to say cause your dead in the ground\nOur corpses, our vessels, our spirits will alight\nNaked and nervous in the ruins of fading light\n\nIn flesh ?abissals?\nThe meaning ?will ?rise?\nNo heaven, just hell\nIn the ruins of fading light\n\nOur corpses, our vessels, our spirits will alight\nNaked and nervous in the ruins of fading light\n\nIn flesh ?abissals?\nThe meaning ?will ?rise?\nNo heaven, just hell\nIn the ruins of fading light\n\nCorpses, flesh vessels, our spirits will take flight\nNo heaven just hell\nThe ruins, the ruins of fading light\n\nThis flesh ?abissals?\nAnd you search for the truth to alight\nThere's no heaven\nIn the ruins of fading light rage on"

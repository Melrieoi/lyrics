          "lyrics": "Hard bony limbs covered in leathered skin\nBehind his eyes with the rage of ten warped men\nWithout a sound he steals right through the night\nThe sign of death to him brings grim delight\n\nThose marked for death can feel him coming near\nSome stand in fight and some just cry in fear\nOn a horse black, the dark lord takes to flight\nBut no one forgets the Highlander rode tonight\n\n(x2)\nCan't you hear his call\nThe Mightiest will fall\nHe will control your destiny\nMany mortal screams out of agony\nThe Highlander has come for me\n\n(approx)\nWe all see him kneel, after the ... ... fathers\nThose who died on the field of battle, ... (grunt/shout)\nYes slay 500 noble men and did not need to many, no (NO!)\n(approx)\n\nThere's no white spell to best this Earth Pig born\nAgainst his kind an eternal oath was sworn\nAll kinds of men will fall beneath his blade\nWomen and children, the choice it has been made\n\nYou see him fighting across the field\nSome Stand and fight and some just cry in fear\nOn a horse black, the dark lord takes to flight\nBut no one forgets the Highlander rode tonight"

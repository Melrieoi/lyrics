          "lyrics": "Hard bony limbs covered in leathered skin\nBehind his eyes with the rage of ten warped men\nWithout a sound he steals right through the night\nThe sign of death to him brings grim delight\n\nThose marked for death can feel him coming near\nSome stand in fight and some just cry in fear\nOn a horse black, the dark lord takes to flight\nBut no one forgets the Highlander rode tonight\n\n(x2)\nCan't you hear his call\nThe Mightiest will fall\nHe will control your destiny\nMany mortal screams out of agony\nThe Highlander has come for me\n\n(approx)\nWe all see him kneel, after the ... ... fathers\nThose who died on the field of battle, ... (grunt/shout)\nYes slay 500 noble men and did not need to many, no (NO!)\n(approx)\n\nThere's no white spell to best this Earth Pig born\nAgainst his kind an eternal oath was sworn\nAll kinds of men will fall beneath his blade\nWomen and children, the choice it has been made\n\nYou see him fighting across the field\nSome Stand and fight and some just cry in fear\nOn a horse black, the dark lord takes to flight\nBut no one forgets the Highlander rode tonight"

          "lyrics": "And the bodies of the Sesair spread across the barren plains\nAnd my heart did rise to celebrate as I pulled upon the reigns\nThen I heard the sound of flutes and drums through the twisted tangled trees\nSo I drove the deer-skin chariot and the thickets covered me\n\nWhere is the road to lead me home?\nFor my eyes and arms a weary and I wear a crown of thorns\nWhen will I claim my rightful crown\nFor the forst sky is bleary and my horses hooves are ground\n\nSo we rode into the clearing as the moon rose full and bright\nAnd before us stood a statue made of branched found up tight\nAll around it danced the witches of the Horned One in a rage\nSetting fire to the rogues imprisoned in a bracken cage\n\nWho will come to set the prisoners free\nFor their fate looks dark and dreary and they're infidels like me\nThen a flash came from the clearing open up before my eyes\nPainted shaman and his acolytes rode in and gave the sign\nHighest Drunelord of the Horned One she'd his antlers his skin\nWith a waving of his arms I joined the rogues to burn within\n\nSoon I will break us out of this cage\nOr the fire will consume us, we'll be back and in a rage"

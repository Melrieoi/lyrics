(grunt/shout)\nYes slay 500 noble men and did not need to many, no (NO!)\n(approx)\n\nThere's no white spell to best this Earth Pig born\nAgainst his kind an eternal oath was sworn\nAll kinds of men will fall beneath his blade\nWomen and children, the choice it has been made\n\nYou see him fighting across the field\nSome Stand and fight and some just cry in fear\nOn a horse black, the dark lord takes to flight\nBut no one forgets the Highlander rode tonight"

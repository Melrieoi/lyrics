          "lyrics": "A place that binds you\nThe blackest hole\nThey'll never find you\nAnd they never know, just what you saw\n\nForever searching\nThe quest goes on\nYour fate is clouded\nYou soldier on, a madman to some\n\nA sign of solace\nSecrets revealed\nThe night will guide you, everything changed but not how you feel\n\nAt the gates of hell\nYou will count your ?cause\nIn/at a demons ...\nThe final stand of freedom is lost\n\nGot a soul of fire\nBound for the lost and fallen\nGot a soul of fire\nBound for the lost and fallen\n\nTo the night by the black moon in the sky\nYou never cried\nIn dark and lonely\nSo many times, ?wanting it done\n\nThe rest is past now\nBut I still believe\nBehind the shadow\nYou have a gift, something unique\n\nAt the gates of hell\nDid you find the way\nIn the grip of a spell\nDid you grow ...\n\nGot a soul of fire\nBound for the lost and fallen\nGot a soul of fire\nBound for the lost and fallen\nThrough the dark by the black moon in the sky\n\n2x\nGot a soul of fire\nBound for the lost and fallen\nGot a soul of fire\nBound for the lost and fallen\n\nTo the place that binds you\nTo the dark of the black moon in the sky"
